# CPU-Scheduling-Algorithms
## CSCI 340 "Operating Systems Principles" Project 1

This project implements 4 CPU scheduling algorithms:

<ul>
  <li>First Come First Serve</li>
  <li>Round Robin</li>
  <li>Shortest Job First</li>
  <li>Priority</li>
 </ul>

Each algorithm prints a Gantt chart and calculates the average wait and turn-around times for a given CPU schedule. The source folder contains 
additonal documentation on the code structure and implementation. A variety of different data structures and programming paradigms were used in the implementation of these
algorithms such as: Object Oriented Programming, Arrays, and ArrayLists. 


 ## Deliverables:
 <ul>
  <li>All four algorithms implemented</li>
  <li>A README file containing information about the code structure</li>
  <li>Fully documented code</li>
 </ul>
